## Musical Thoughts Project

- I developed this basic website as my capstone project for the wonderful 
Web Design for Everybody Specialization from University of Michigan on Coursera.
- I developed this website in order to share my own thoughts about music that I like, 
and to practice my own music theory chops!
- Absolutely would appreciate any feedback on improving the articles content, and the website
design itself.
- The main technologies used were Boostrap, HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
