                In this article, I will be sharing why I love the song Stjernestøv, as peformed by AURORA.
                I am very excited to share this song because I immediately fell in love with it after hearing
                it for the first time. In fact, soon after, I went to my keyboard to try and figure out the 
                melody and the chords, in order to cover it. My light musical analysis of that will also be 
                included throughout the article. Ultimately, I think why I enjoyed it so much, is because I 
                found the song to be quite dynamic, beautiful and it feels the song takes us on a journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                I don't think AURORA needs too much of an introduction as many already know her. She is a popular
                Norwegian singer and songwriter, with her most popular songs on Spotify being Runaway and 
                Cure For Me. However unlike those songs, Stjernestøv is not written by her, and is in 
                Norwegian, her native language. This song was written by Gaute Tønder, Ida Sagmo Tvedte,
                Karianne Lund, and produced by Gaute Tønder, and Olav Waastad, all for a Norwegian Christmas
                TV series of the same name.

                Before continuing this article, definitely go ahead and give the song a listen here:

                Beginning with the song itself, I wasn't sure what genre to prescribe it to, but I would call it 
                generally Folk Pop. The song appears to be in the key of D# minor. When I wrote my own sheet music 
                for this song for the piano, the key signature that I found most appropriate was the D# minor 
                key-signature. Finally, though a much weaker point is that the melody of the song begins and ends 
                with a D#, and the chord the song begins with is a D# minor.
                </p>
                <p>
                The time signature, I found to be best annotated using 4-4 time, and it seems to be at around ~80bpm
                give or take.
                </p>
                <p>
                A - B - A - B - A' - A
                </p>
                <p>
                The song generally follows this verse (A), chorus (B) structure, except at the end, where the A' 
                verse represents a variation from the main melody of A. Overall the song is pretty simple in it's
                structure, but what gives it some ext5ra added intiruge to me is its interesting chord 
                progression, and its dynamic progression, in the musical sense, and in the narrative the song
                tells.

                The song with what seems to be a violin, or another stringed instrument performing a simple yet 
                beautiful introductory melody. introductory melody, is as follows:

                <p>
                This seems to be the first three chords of the Andalusian Cadence. However, it is definitely not 
                in the same context. In particular, the third chord, which I said was a Major-7th definitely makes
                changes up the feel. Noramlly, in the Andalusian Cadence, those VII and VI chords have a similar 
                chord quality, but by making one a 7th chord, it definitely makes it sound a bit more mysterious, 
                having both major and minor qualities, in this case the VI chord was changed. Additionally,
                the Andalusian Cadence is often used more in Flamenco, and other Spanish folk songs, 
                which this song is certainly not an example of. Another interesting
                think to point out, is that the lowest notes in the chords, move in the opposite direction of the 
                melody. This small counterpoint moment, is definitely apparent in the snog.

                After the violin introduction, AURORA begins singing, with a monotone melody, in the first verse, 
                that starts quietly, as if sung in a lullaby. The chords in the back are played very lightly in an 
                arpeggio, with a solid bass-line also being played. It sounds like a keyboard or maybe a Xylophone, 
                and a bass. The sheet music I have created for this is shown below, including the chord progression:
